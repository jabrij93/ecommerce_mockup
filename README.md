Guide to run the app

Before running the web-app, make sure the XAMPP settings are correct.
Apache Web Server and MySQL Database settings both can be run.
In case, it didn't run, usually it's because of port configuration. Make sure port configuration are set-up correctly.
After both Apache Web Server and MySQL Database can be run, then just follow the following guide :

1. composer install
2. npm install
3. Run 'php artisan db:seed'
4. Run 'php artisan serve'
5. Open another terminal, run 'npm run dev'
6. For login, use the following email : 'janedoe@gmail.com', password : 'password'
7. Enjoy exploring the web app !

In my project, I use Sequel Pro to store the MySQL Database. Thanks !
